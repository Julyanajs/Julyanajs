 Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software quality engineer passionate about manual testing and automation. I have experience with frameworks like Selenium and Cypress. My true passion lies in backend testing, and I have been studying the latest technologies.

Currently, I work as a software quality engineer, dividing my activities between manual and development testing, with a focus on end-to-end and API testing.

On this GitHub page, you will find projects that showcase my experience and knowledge. My goal is to deliver high-quality software and collaborate with agile teams.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out for collaborations. Let's create quality-driven solutions that exceed expectations.

Thank you for visiting, and let's make a difference in software quality engineering! üëã
